# Python-Selenium-Download-Files
Download files with python-selenium-chromedriver-linux

Spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to get my python selenium script to download a file.
It is disabled by default but this little fix works for me on Ubuntu Server 16.04.5 LTS, Python 2.7.12, Chromium 68.0.3440.75 and ChromeDriver 2.41.578700. It is a result of a combination of multiple posts online which individually did not work for me so created this.
